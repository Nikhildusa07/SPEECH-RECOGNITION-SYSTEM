#  DESCRIPTION

SpeechToTextSystem is a Flask-based web application that converts spoken audio into accurate text using a hybrid approach combining **Wav2Vec2** (deep learning) and **Google SpeechRecognition** (cloud-based API). Users can upload or record audio directly in the browser and receive fast, reliable transcriptions.

##  FEATURES

-  Upload or record speech using your browser
-  Hybrid speech recognition (Wav2Vec2 + Google SpeechRecognition)
-  View and copy accurate transcriptions
-  Fast response time with clean UI
-  Built with Flask, Hugging Face Transformers, and WebAudio API

---

##  HOW IT WORKS

- **Wav2Vec2**: A transformer-based model trained on large audio datasets for deep learning speech recognition.
- **Google SpeechRecognition**: Cloud-based API used as a backup or enhancer for improved transcription.
- The app selects or merges results from both methods for better accuracy.
